# pandas-challenge
Module 4 Challenge


For this assignment, I primarily used the classwork and starter code to help me through the challenge.
Google did not help me very much with the exception of finding the option of doing the nunique() function. For this I used https://practicaldatascience.co.uk/data-science/how-to-identify-and-count-unique-values-in-pandas#:~:text=To%20count%20the%20number%20of,the%20number%20of%20unique%20values.

I used Ask BCS to help me fix my data summary for the District data. I forgot to use pd.DataFrame which was causing a return of 'int' object has no attribute 'map'
