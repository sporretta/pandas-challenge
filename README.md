## About
Fot the PyCity Schools proect we are analyzing 25 different schools and the performance in math and reading in all of the schools. We are taking into consideration the budget, the number of students and even the average test grades in different subjects in the school. 

This assignment gives us practice in grouping, summarizing, and drawing conclusions around sets of data that reside in a csv file. We are able to read a file, group different schools within the file and find average scores of different subjects within the file.
